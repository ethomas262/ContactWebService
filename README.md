# How to Ensure Functional and Secure Code, Program, or Software

There are many methods to ensure that software is functional and secure, although most projects start with collecting requirements and identifying the functional and non-functional requirements for the system. After doing this, my approach to designing this application was test-driven development supported by JUnit. Designing good unit tests for the application based on the requirements needed before coding the solution helped tremendously and made troubleshooting any problems I ran into easier.

## Interpreting User Needs and Incorporating Them into a Program

Collecting requirements requires an open dialogue between the technical experts, product manager, and stakeholders of the idea. Considerations such as compatibility, financial resources, security requirements, and the purpose of the application must be hashed out and documented to give the developers a good starting place and outline for what needs to be done.

## Approaching Software Design

My approach to software design is pragmatic at its core. I first approach the solution in its most basic form to get started. This means identifying the primitive data types needed, looking for data structures that may work well for this use case, and visualizing what a brute force or simple solution would look like. After I have a good general approach, it's time to optimize and identify any potential roadblocks I may face during development. This could mean setting up the environment and researching any "black boxes" that I may run into. Finally, it's time to design and develop the code in tandem with the testing when I feel I have hit a crucial milestone in development, refining and redesigning as necessary.
